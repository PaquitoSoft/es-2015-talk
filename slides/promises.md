##  <a href="http://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/promise">Promises</a>

* Mainly designed to avoid _callback hell_
* Easier to chain async (and sync) functions
* Allow for grouping tasks together
* Allow to create _resolved_ promises
* _Easier_ to reason about errors in a chain
* New browser APIs are promise based (ex: <a href="http://devdocs.io/dom/fetch_api/using_fetch">fetch</a>, <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/service-worker/introduction/">Service Workers</a>)
